# Internationalization of New O3 Modules

Internationalization is the process of designing software applications to be adapted easily for different languages and regions without requiring significant engineering changes. The goal of internationalization is to make the application locale-aware, meaning that it can be easily adapted to different locales or regions without requiring any changes to the codebase.
We use [react-i18next](https://react.i18next.com/) to internationalize frontend module content.

In order to internationalize your frontend module, add this line in the index.ts file to tell the app shell where to find the translation files.

```ts copy
const importTranslation = require.context(
  "../translations",
  false,
  /.json$/,
  "lazy"
);
```

All translations are added in the `translations` directory which is at the top level of the package. The source file for translations is the `en.json` which contains english translations of all hardcoded text.
To add translations of another language eg. Spanish, create a new `es.json` file in the `translations` directory. When the user changes their preferred language, the application loads the appropriate resource file and displays the text in the user's preferred language.

Here is an example of using react-i18next localization in your react components.

```ts copy
import { useTranslation } from "react-i18next";

const ActiveVisitsTable = () => {
  const { t } = useTranslation();

  return <h4>{t("activeVisits", "Active Visits")}</h4>;
};
```

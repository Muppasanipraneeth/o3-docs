# Creating a frontend module

The [Template](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-esm-template-app) frontend module can be used as a starting point for creating a new frontend module. To create a new frontend module, you can either fork the Template repository or clone and copy it over to the new repository.

## Example: Creating a new frontend module

<Callout emoji="ℹ️" type="info">
  Note that we're setting this repo up as a
  [polyrepo](https://monorepo.tools/#what-is-a-monorepo). If you want to create
  a new frontend module in a monorepo, see the note about monorepos below.
</Callout>

Suppose you want to create a frontend module that provides a UI for managing referrals.
The process for doing that would be as follows:

<Steps>

### Step 1

Go to the Github repository for the [Template](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-esm-template-app) seed app and click the `Use this template` button. Click `Create a new repository` and follow the instructions to create a new repository. Clone the new repository to your local machine. In this case, we'll name the new repository `openmrs-esm-referrals-queue`. Click the `Create repository from template` button and then clone the new repository to your local machine.

### Step 2

Next, we'll follow the steps in the README to adapt the code to our needs. That'll include the following steps:

- Replace all instances of `template` with `referrals-queue`.
- Rename the files with `hello` in their name to `root`. For example, `src/hello/hello.component.tsx` should be renamed to `src/root/root.component.tsx`.
- Update the app entry point at `src/index.ts` as appropriate, including the following:

  - Change the `moduleName` to `@openmrs/esm-referrals-queue`.
  - Change the featureName from `hello-world` to a blank string. You'll change this to a more useful value later on.
  - Rename the `hello` export to `root`.
  - Remove the `redBox`, `blueBox` and `brandBox` named exports.

- Next, in the `routes.json` file, replace the value of the `extensions` with an empty array and then replace the contents of the `pages` array with the following:

  ```json
  {
    // ...
    "extensions": [],
    "pages": [
      {
        "component": "root",
        "route": "root"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

  This configuration makes it so that navigating to the `root` route loads the component exported by the `root` named export.

- Next, delete the `boxes`, `greeter` and `patient-greeter` directories.
- Next, replace the contents of your app's configuration schema (in `config-schema.ts`) with the following:

  ```ts
  import { Type, validator } from "@openmrs/esm-framework";

  export const configSchema = {};

  export type Config = {};
  ```

  You can tweak this file later on to add your own configuration options.

- Delete the translation keys and strings in `translations/en.json`.
- Replace all instances of `hello` with `root`, and `Hello` with `Root`.
- Amend the contents of the test file at `root.test.tsx` to use an empty configuration schema.
- Amend `root.component.tsx` as follows:
  - Rename the default exports from `Hello` to `Root`.
  - Remove the `Boxes`, `Greeter`, and `PatientGetter` imports.
  - Replace the contents of the `<div>` with `<p>Referrals Queue goes here</p>`.

### Step 3

Profit! You should now have a custom frontend module that you can use in your OpenMRS application.

</Steps>

The process for creating a new frontend module in a monorepo is nearly identical to the one for creating one in a polyrepo with a few tweaks:

1. Put the contents of the Template into a new directory under `packages/`. For our example above, we'd create a new directory called `packages/esm-referrals-queue` and move the contents of Template into it.
2. Remove configuration files that are already present at the workspace level. These include files and folders such as `.github` and `.eslintrc`.
3. Remove `devDependencies` from the new frontend module's `package.json`
   which are already in the `devDependencies` of the `package.json` at
   the workspace level.

That's it!

## Integrating your frontend module into your application

Once you've created a frontend module, you'll want to integrate it into your application. There are two steps for doing so.

First, publish your frontend module package to NPM. At the end, your package should be visible on npm.js,
such as [`@openmrs/esm-login-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@openmrs/esm-login-app).

Then, you'll need to integrate this package into your distribution. Information about that can be found in the Implementer Documentation on
[Deployment](https://wiki.openmrs.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=224527013).

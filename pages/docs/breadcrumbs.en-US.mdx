# Breadcrumbs

Breadcrumbs are a user interface design pattern that helps users understand their current location within a website or application. They are a navigational aid that displays a hierarchical trail of links from the homepage to the current page. Breadcrumbs are commonly displayed horizontally near the top of the page and use the greater than symbol `/` to indicate hierarchy.

In OpenMRS breadcrumbs are implemented in the `index.ts` file using the `registerBreadCrumbs` function exported by `@openmrs/esm-framework` package.
The registerBreadcrumb function takes an object with two properties: `path` and `title`. The `path` property is the URL path of the page, and the `title` property is the text that will be displayed in the breadcrumb. When a user navigates to the registered page, the breadcrumb will be displayed with the specified title.

Here is an example of a simple breadcrumb for a page:

```ts
import { registerBreadcrumb } from "@openmrs/esm-framework";

function setupOpenmrs() {
  registerBreadcrumb({
    path: `${window.spaBase}/myPage`,
    title: "My First Page",
  });

  return {
    // specify your pages or extensions
  };
}
```

The breadcrumb will be displayed to the user as `My First Page`

Breadcrumbs can also represent a trail of hieracical links from the site homepage to sub pages. To implement this, use the `parent` property to indicate what should
be the parent breadcrumb.

Here is an example of a breadcrumb with ancestors/sub pages:

```ts
import { registerBreadcrumbs } from "@openmrs/esm-framework";

function setupOpenmrs() {
  registerBreadcrumbs([
    {
      path: `${window.spaBase}/myPage`,
      title: "My First Page",
    },
    {
      path: `${window.spaBase}/myPage/subpage1`,
      title: "Subpage 1",
      parent: `${window.spaBase}/myPage`,
    },
    {
      path: `${window.spaBase}/myPage/subpage2`,
      title: "Subpage 2",
      parent: `${window.spaBase}/myPage`,
    },
  ]);

  return {
    // specify your pages or extensions
  };
}
```

The breadcrumb will be displayed to the user as `My First Page` `My First Page / Subpage 1` `My First Page / Subpage 2 `

Here is an example of how to use breadcrumbs in your component:

```ts
<ExtensionSlot name={slotName} />
```

Breadcrumbs are implemented as an extension provided by the app-shell.

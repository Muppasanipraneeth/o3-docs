# Overview

<Callout emoji="ℹ️" type="info">
  Significant changes to the architecture of the app shell related to how
  frontend modules get loaded were introduced in [Core v5](/docs/changelog). If

Frontend modules are the basic building blocks of O3. In O3, frontend modules are self-contained pieces of functionality that can be loaded into the app shell. They are typically organized into domain-specific [monorepos](https://monorepo.tools/#what-is-a-monorepo). For example, frontend modules concerning the management of patients exist in the [Patient Management](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-esm-patient-management) monorepo.

In this structure, you'll typically have a `packages` directory at the root of your monorepo. This packages directory will contain all of your frontend modules. For example, the patient management monorepo has the following structure:

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="packages" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.Folder name="esm-active-visits-app" />
    <FileTree.Folder name="esm-appointments-app" />
    <FileTree.Folder name="esm-outpatient-app" />
    <FileTree.Folder name="esm-patient-list-app" />
    <FileTree.Folder name="esm-patient-registration-app" />
    <FileTree.Folder name="esm-patient-search-app" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.Folder name="src" defaultOpen>
        <FileTree.File name="config-schema.ts" />
        <FileTree.File name="declarations.d.ts" />
        <FileTree.File name="index.ts" />
        <FileTree.File name="routes.json" />
      </FileTree.Folder>
    </FileTree.Folder>
  </FileTree.Folder>
  <FileTree.File name="package.json" />
  <FileTree.File name="yarn.lock" />
</FileTree>

Each frontend module has its own `package.json` file separate from the root-level `package.json` file. This is because each frontend module is a separate NPM package. This means that each frontend module can have its own scripts and dependencies. Additionally, each frontend module has a `src` directory that contains the source code for the frontend module. The `src` directory also contains two important files from the perspective of the app shell - `index.ts` and `routes.json`. These two files define the dynamic and static metadata of the frontend module, respectively. They are discussed in more detail below.

Frontend modules are also referred to as `microfrontends` in O3. They get shipped in the ES module format, which explains the `esm-` prefix in their nomenclature. They may have an `-app` suffix in their name, but this is not required. In O3, frontend modules typically consist of React components, but this is not a requirement. They can be written in any frontend framework that [single-spa](https://single-spa.js.org/) supports. For example, the [Angular form engine] frontend module is written in Angular and is a wrapper around the [AMPATH form engine](https://ampath-forms.vercel.app/). So in that sense, the app shell is framework-agnostic. In practice, the lower-level workings of the app shell have been abstracted in such a way that frontend engineers can focus on writing frontend modules without having to worry about the underlying framework.

Frontend modules get loaded into the application based on a special JSON file called an [import map](http://localhost:3001/docs/core-concepts#import-map). More details about how frontend modules get loaded are discussed in the [App shell](/docs/app-shell) and [Module loading](/docs/frontend-modules/loading-modules) guide.

This diagram walks through what happens when the application gets executed. The app shell loads configuration files, the import map specifies where frontend modules get fetched from, and [loads frontend modules](/docs/frontend-modules/module-loading).

## Anatomy of a frontend module

### Manifest file (package.json)

Each frontend module has a root-level `package.json` file that defines its dependencies and metadata. Below is a snippet of the `package.json` file from the form builder frontend module:

```json
{
  "name": "@openmrs/esm-form-builder-app",
  "version": "2.0.1",
  "license": "MPL-2.0",
  "description": "OpenMRS ESM Form Builder App",
  "browser": "dist/openmrs-esm-form-builder-app.js",
  "main": "src/index.ts",
  "source": true,
  "scripts": {
    "start": "openmrs develop",
    "serve": "webpack serve --mode=development",
    "build": "webpack --mode production",
    "analyze": "webpack --mode=production --env.analyze=true",
    "lint": "TIMING=1 eslint src --ext js,jsx,ts,tsx",
    "prettier": "prettier --write \"src/**/*.{ts,tsx}\"",
    "typescript": "tsc",
    "test": "jest --config jest.config.js",
    "test-e2e": "playwright test",
    "verify": "turbo lint typescript coverage",
    "coverage": "yarn test --coverage --passWithNoTests",
    "postinstall": "husky install",
    "extract-translations": "i18next 'src/**/*.component.tsx' --config ./i18next-parser.config.js",
    "ci:bump-form-engine-lib": "yarn up @openmrs/openmrs-form-engine-lib@next"
  }
}
```

Some key things to note from looking at this file include:

- The `name` property which defines the name of the module. This property is used as the module’s unique identifier in the [import map](/docs/core-concepts#import-map).
- The `browser` property which points to the entry point of the webpack bundle.
- The `main` property which defines the [entry point](#the-application-entry-point-indexts) of the frontend module’s source code, which is typically `src/index.ts`.

### The application entry point (`index.ts`)

Frontend modules have their [entry point](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/entry-points/) defined in `src/index.ts`.

```ts
import {
  defineConfigSchema,
  getAsyncLifecycle,
  registerBreadcrumbs,
} from "@openmrs/esm-framework";
import { configSchema } from "./config-schema";

const moduleName = "@openmrs/esm-form-builder-app";

const options = {
  featureName: "form-builder",
  moduleName,
};

export const importTranslation = require.context(
  "../translations",
  true,
  /.json$/,
  "lazy"
);

export const root = getAsyncLifecycle(
  () => import("./root.component"),
  options
);

export const systemAdministrationFormBuilderCardLink = getAsyncLifecycle(
  () => import("./form-builder-admin-card-link.component"),
  options
);

export function startupApp() {
  defineConfigSchema(moduleName, configSchema);

  registerBreadcrumbs([
    {
      path: `${window.spaBase}/form-builder`,
      title: "Form Builder",
      parent: `${window.spaBase}/home`,
    },
    {
      path: `${window.spaBase}/form-builder/new`,
      title: "Form Editor",
      parent: `${window.spaBase}/form-builder`,
    },
    {
      path: `${window.spaBase}/form-builder/edit/:uuid`,
      title: "Form Editor",
      parent: `${window.spaBase}/form-builder`,
    },
  ]);
}
```

This file is the entry point of the frontend module. It is the first file that gets executed when the frontend module gets loaded. It is responsible for setting up the frontend module and exporting the module’s configuration. Specifically, in this example:

- It exports an `importTranslation` function which is used to load the module’s translations.
- It also exports two named exports, `root` and `systemAdministrationFormBuilderCardLink`. These are named exports for a page and an extension, respectively. They are used to tell the app shell how to load the frontend module’s content.
- It also exports a `startupApp` function which is used to set up the frontend module. In this case, the frontend module's configuration schema gets defined here, as well as the breadcrumbs for the module.

#### The `startupApp` function

Each frontend module defines a function named `startupApp`. This function performs any setup that should occur at the time the module gets loaded. It returns an object that communicates how the app shell should load the module. The startupApp function where

- define the module's [configuration schema](config.md).
- register [breadcrumbs](breadcrumbs.md).

#### The `importTranslation` function

This is required for translations to work. It tells the frontend application
how to load translation strings. Note that the first argument to
`require.context` is a directory, `../translations`.
That directory must exist at that location relative to the `index.ts` file.

### Static metadata in `routes.json`

The `routes.json` file is used to set up the frontend module's static metadata. These include:

- The `extensions` that frontend module provides.
- The `pages` that frontend module provides.
- The `backend` dependencies that frontend module requires. This is an object that tells the frontend application what OpenMRS server modules the frontend module depends on, and what versions. If these dependencies are not met, administrators will be alerted.

The structure of this static file is dictated by the OpenMRS Routes standard [JSON schema](https://json.openmrs.org/routes.schema.json).

### Creating a page

To create a new page, you'll typically need to follow these steps:

- Create a new React component that will be the page's entry point.
- Add a named export for the page in the `index.ts` file. For example, here's how a page named `root` is exported from the `index.ts` file:

  ```typescript
  export const root = getAsyncLifecycle(() => import("./root"), options);
  ```

- Add a page definition for the new page to the `routes.json` file's `pages` array:

  ```json
  {
    "pages": [
      {
        "component": "root", // maps to the named export in `index.ts`
        "route": "form-builder",
        "online": true,
        "offline": true
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

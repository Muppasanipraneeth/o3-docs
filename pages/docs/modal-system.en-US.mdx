# The modal system

The modal system is a part of the framework that handles rendering modal dialogs, warnings, and other similar displays. Its main goal is to coordinate modals across different applications so that only a single modal is rendered for the user at a time without any other modals being removed.

To use the modal system, first your application must register the modal, as described below. Once the modal is registered, call [`showModal`](https://o3-docs.openmrs.org/docs/framework-api-reference#showmodal) with the modal name and the framework will render the modal for you.

## Usage

### Implementation of the modal
The `ModalHeader` and `ModalBody` should be at the top level of the modal component and wrapped in a `React.Fragment`.

```tsx
const ModalComponent = ({ onClose, props }) => {
    return (
        <React.Fragment>
            <ModalHeader closeModal={onClose} >
                {header content goes here}
            </ModalHeader>
            <ModalBody>
                {modal body goes here}
            </ModalBody>
            <ModalFooter>
                {modal footer goes here}
            </ModalFooter>
        </React.Fragment>
    )
}
```

<Callout>
Failing to wrap your modal in a React Fragment would cause the modal body to not vertical-scroll properly.
</Callout>

### Registering the modal
You should register the modal by name in the `modals` property in the `routes.json` and should be named as an export in the `index.ts` of the app that defines the modal.

```json filename="routes.json"
    "modals": [
    {
      "name": "your-modal-name",
      "component": "modalComponentName"
    }
  ]
```

```ts filename="index.ts"
import { getAsyncLifecycle } from '@openmrs/esm-framework';

export const modalComponentName = getAsyncLifecycle(
  () => import('/path-to-the-modal-component/modal-component.tsx'),
  options,
);
```

### Triggering the modal
Finally, you can trigger your modal by calling `showModal` along with all the props you need to pass into the modal. In the below example, we've passed in `onClose` as a prop to the modal component.
The dispose function that is returned by `showModal` can be called to "dispose" or force close the modal.
```ts 
const dispose = showModal('your-modal-name', {
    onClose: () => dispose(),
    //props to pass in to the modal component
});
```

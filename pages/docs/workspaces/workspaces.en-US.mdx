# Workspaces

The Workspace is the interactive layer of the Patient Chart. It opens on the right side of the screen on a desktop computer, or in a drawer over the screen on smaller screens. It is where data entry, form filling, and ordering takes place. The design of the Workspace system is in [the OpenMRS Styleguide](https://zeroheight.com/23a080e38/p/483a22-workspace).

The actual area of the screen in the Patient Chart where the Workspaces appear is called the Workspace Window. Things like forms and the order basket are each Workspaces, and those Workspaces open in the Workspace Window.

Any new Workspace should conform to one of the three variants described in the [the OpenMRS Styleguide](https://zeroheight.com/23a080e38/p/483a22-workspace). These variants provide guidelines about Workspace styling and behavior.

A Workspace is essentially a component that has been [registered](./creating-workspaces) as a Workspace with a `name` and a `type`. The `name` should be unique to the Workspace, since it will be used to look up the component when launching. Different Workspaces may have the same `type`. The Workspace system will not allow multiple Workspaces of the same type to be open at the same time. Currently existing types are `form`, `clinical-form` (a special form), `order`, and `patient-lists`. If you add a new [Siderail Nav Button](./siderail-nav-buttons), it will correspond to a new Workspace type. Otherwise you may create your own type or use an existing one, according to the desired behavior.

Once a workspaces is [registered](./creating-workspaces), it may be [launched](./launching-workspace) anywhere in the Patient Chart.

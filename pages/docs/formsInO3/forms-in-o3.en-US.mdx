# Forms in O3

## How to Build Forms with the O3 Form Builder GUI
Your BAs or Devs can use the Form Builder UI to set up and maintain O3 Forms. 
* See the thorough User Guide for the Form Builder here: https://ampath-forms.vercel.app/docs/quickstart
* Prerequisites & dependencies are covered here: https://ampath-forms.vercel.app/docs/developer-guide/run-form-engine-in-openmrs3#prerequisites
* More information and code-running instructions directly in the README of the [ESM Form Builder app repo here](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-esm-form-builder#openmrs-esm-form-builder-app)
  * For example, here is a complete list of common field types used in forms, with examples. The JSON from these examples can even be copy-pasted into the JSON editing field: ampath-forms.vercel.app/field-types-reference 
* Note: There are some logic pieces that get trickier, such as validation logic. This is where your team may want devs to step in to write the JSON rules required. Documentation on how to handle trickier use cases is covered here, e.g. Validating Fields: ampath-forms.vercel.app/validating-fields

# How to convert existing HTML Form Entry Forms 

Many implementers have previously been using the OpenMRS HTML Form Entry Module, and have sets of existing forms they wish to transition into O3 Forms. 

Fortunately, you do not have to start from scratch, thanks to the Automated Schema Migration tool created by Palladium-Kenya: https://github.com/palladiumkenya/openmrs-module-afyastat/blob/1519b9e0b6a7d6b0ac8ac9e1cfe4cbab5c608aa8/README2.md#automation-of-html-to-json-schema-migration 

This tool takes your existing HFE schemas and converts them to a JSON schema that O3 can leverage. It will probably not be able to convert 100% of your HFE schemas, but will get you far enough along that the remaining tweaks can be done either in the JSON or with the Form Builder GUI tool.

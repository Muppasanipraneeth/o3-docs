# Testing

- [Avoid the test user](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/avoid-the-test-user).
- Avoid testing implementation details. Instead, test the component's public API. This makes it easier to refactor the component without having to rewrite the tests.
- Follow the guidelines outlined [here](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/common-mistakes-with-react-testing-library).
- Don't make these common testing [mistakes](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/common-testing-mistakes).
- [Write fewer, longer tests](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/write-fewer-longer-tests).
- Structure large test suites using [object page models](https://playwright.dev/docs/pom) when writing e2e tests using Playwright.
- Follow the e2e testing [best practices](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-best-practices) outlined in the Playwright docs.
- When stubbing out functionality from `@openmrs/esm-framework`, follow the mocking patterns described [here](/docs/frontend-modules/unit-and-integration-testing#mocking-patterns).
